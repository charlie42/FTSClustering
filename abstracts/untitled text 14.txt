The author describes his experience assisting mentally disabled patients with homeopathy. In these patients' anamneses, common traits shared by some syndromes, pathologies and behaviour, were taken into consideration, mainly to choose the most characteristic symptoms in each case. The study includes 58 cases of patients suffering from this pathology: 28 females and 30 males, ages ranging from 1 to 49 years (mean 20). Forty-seven had some improvement. Homeopathy is a useful alternative to relieve pathologies associated with mental disability. In those cases in which there were similarities between remedy and whole symptomatology, improvements in adaptation skills and in overall health were observed.
